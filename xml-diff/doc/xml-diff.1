The \f[I]xml\-diff\f[] utility marks changes on elements between two
versions of an XML document.
The attribute diff:change is placed on changed elements, with a value
indicating the presumed type of change, "add" for new elements and
"modify" for modified elements.
If all child elements of an element are changed, only the parent element
will receive the change mark.
